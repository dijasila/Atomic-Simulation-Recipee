Unlike python, HTML code does not throw errors when you do bad things.
So when developing HTML code in python, we need to ensure that what we
provide to our templates is valid **BEFORE** handing it off to the renderer.
This means we **must** have a way to test the individual components of each
webpage.

Here are some resources to validate HTML code
- Find the organization responsible for standards for HTML [here](https://whatwg.org/)
- Use [this](https://validator.w3.org/) website to validate your HTML code
- Use [this](https://realpython.com/html-css-python/) website to learn some
  basics of HTML formatting so you can easily navigate HTML files
