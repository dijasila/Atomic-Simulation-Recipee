Welcome to Atomic Simulation Recipes's documentation!
=====================================================
Recipes for Atomic Scale Materials Research.

Welcome to ASR's documentation. The goal of ASR is to assist
computational atomic scale materials research and accelerate
productivity. ASR seeks to achieve this by implementing a
*light-weight* Python framework of tools and :ref:`common tasks
<recipes>` that can be tailored to users needs.

First time here: :ref:`Getting started`


.. Admonition:: Overview of documentation

   The documentation is divided into four categories:
   
   * :ref:`Tutorials`: Lessons that take the reader by the hand though a
     series of steps to complete a project.
   * :ref:`How to guides`: Concrete solutions to common tasks.
   * :ref:`Explanations`: Explanations that clarify and
     illuminate a particular topic.
   * :ref:`API Reference`: Technical documentation of the code.
