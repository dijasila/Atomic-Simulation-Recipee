Welcome to Atomic Simulation Recipes's documentation!
=====================================================
Recipes for Atomic Scale Materials Research.

Collection of python recipes for tasks perfomed in atomic scale
materials research. These tasks include relaxation of structures,
calculating ground states, calculating band structures, calculating
dielectric functions and so on.

First time here: :ref:`Getting started`


.. Admonition:: Overview of documentation

   The documentation is arranged like in the django python project
   `django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com>`_, namely
   into four categories.
   
   * :ref:`Tutorials`: Lessons that take the reader by the hand though a
     series of steps to complete a project.
   * :ref:`How to guides`: Concrete solutions to common tasks
   * :ref:`Topical dicussions`: Topical discussions
   * :ref:`API Reference`:

   See also Daniele Procida's PyCon 2017 talk `How documentation
   works... <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azf6yzuJt54>`_ for
