Welcome to Atomic Simulation Recipes's documentation!
=====================================================
Recipes for Atomic Scale Materials Research.

Warning: This project is under active development but you are welcome to try it out.

Collection of python recipes for common (and not so common)
tasks perfomed in atomic scale materials research. These tasks include
relaxation of structures, calculating ground states, calculating band
structures, calculating dielectric functions and so on.
